: 	I'm really interested:
: 		1) What people think of this
	It's pretty darn neat. :)

: 		2) If I should even bother uploading it to CPAN
	Yes.

: 		3) If I have done the interface in the "right" way
	The user should not need to import the arch lib themself, the
	module should do all of that stuff if it needs to. -But I don't
	think an xs module needs to do this.  Not sure as I haven't touched
	xs yet myself. :)

	Also, I'd recommend exporting Chef::process() as simply chef();
		use Exporter;
		@EXPORT = qw(chef);

	Making chef() default to $_ would be nice too using something like:
		sub chef {
			my $Text = shift || $_;
			...
		}

	This would make things cleaner like:
		use Chef;
		while (<>) {
			print chef;
		}

: 		4) If any of its design problems should be fixed
: 			before releasing
	It shouldn't be a base class.  I'd recommend making it
	package Text::Chef since it does text processing of sorts.

: 		5) Where to find out HOW to upload to CPAN. :)
	I read that info on perl.com or in the FAQ some time ago, but
	don't remember exactly were.  Sorry. :(
