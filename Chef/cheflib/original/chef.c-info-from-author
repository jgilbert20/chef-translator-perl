Jeremy ~

I wrote the original 'chef' program, and placed no restrictions on it.
Lots of legalese would be counter to the spirit of the whole project!
I explained this when I originally posted it to the net, and suggested
that new versions be distributed in the same spirit.  I do appreciate
being acknowledged as the originator.  And I sincerely appreciate your
effort to contact me about this!

Let me know how things go.  Note that I have a new address:

    hagerman@chrysalis.com

Thanks ~ John
