I think Chef would be a bad choice of name, given that there are dozens
of similar filters out there (Jive, Valley, Essex-Girl, ElmerFudd,
etc.), and should really be kept in one place.  Text::Translators would
be a better hierarchy, but then that sounds a little too 'serious'.

Anyway, here's an Elmer Fudd for inspiration:

	#!/usr/local/bin/perl -p

	s/r/w/g;
	s/l/w/g;
	s/qu/qw/g;
	s/th /f /g;
	s/th/d/g;
	s/n\./n\, uh-hah-hah-hah\. /g;
	s/R/W/g;
	s/L/W/g;
	s/Qu/Qw/g;
	s/QU/QW/g;
	s/TH /F /g;
	s/TH/D/g;
	s/Th/D/g;
	s/N\./N\, uh-hah-hah-hah\./g;
